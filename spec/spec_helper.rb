#Investabit API

#The Investabit API allows for access to all of the public facing services provided, including market data and forecasts.  ## General Overview  1. All API methods will be built to adhere to RESTful best practices as closely as possible. As such, all API calls will be made via the standard HTTP protocol using the GET/POST/PUT/DELETE request types.  2. Every request returns the status as a JSON response with the following   - success, true if it was successful   - code, the http status code (also in the response header)          200 if response is successful          400 if bad request          401 if authorization JWT is wrong or limit exceeded          404 wrong route          500 for any internal errors  - status, the status of the request, default **success**  - errors, an array of any relevant error details  3. For any requests that are not successful an error message is specified and returned as an array for the **errors** key in the JSON response.  4. All authentication uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which is set as the **Authorization** entry in the header, see the following for more details.     * http://jwt.io     * https://scotch.io/tutorials/the-anatomy-of-a-json-web-token

# The following  was generated by the `rspec --init` command. Conventionally, all
# specs live under a `spec` directory, which RSpec adds to the `$LOAD_PATH`.
# The generated `.rspec` file contains `--require spec_helper` which will cause
# this file to always be loaded, without a need to explicitly require it in any
# files.
#
# Given that it is always loaded, you are encouraged to keep this file as
# light-weight as possible. Requiring heavyweight dependencies from this file
# will add to the boot time of your test suite on EVERY test run, even for an
# individual file that may not need all of that loaded. Instead, consider making
# a separate helper file that requires the additional dependencies and performs
# the additional setup, and require it from the spec files that actually need
# it.
#
# The `.rspec` file also contains a few flags that are not defaults but that
# users commonly want.
#
# See http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Configuration

    # and `failure_message` of custom matchers include text for helper methods
    # defined using `chain`, e.g.:
    #     be_bigger_than(2).and_smaller_than(4).description
    #     # => "be bigger than 2 and smaller than 4"

  # library (such as bogus or mocha) by changing the `mock_with` option here.
